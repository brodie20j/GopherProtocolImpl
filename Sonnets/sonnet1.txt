RONDEAU 3

 For to love her for her looks lovely
   My heart was set in thought right firmly,
   Trusting by truth to have had redress :
   But she hath made another promise,
   And hath given me leave full honestly.
  
   Yet do I not rejoice it greatly :
   For on my faith I loved too surely :
   But reason will that I do cease
                                     For to love her.
  
Since that in love the pain's been deadly,
   Me think it best that readily
   I do return to my first address ;
   For at this time too great is the press
   And perils appear too abundantly
                                     For to love her.Ffor to love her for her lokes lovely
   My hert was set in thought right fermely,
   Trusting by trouth to have had redresse :
   But she hath made anothr promes,
   And hath geven me leve full honestly.
  
   Yet do I not reioyse it greatly :
   For on my faith I loved to surely :
   But reason will that I do cesse
                                     For to love her.
  
Syns that in love the paynes ben dedly,
   Me thincke it best that reddely
   I do retorn to my first adresse ;
   For at this tyme to great is the prese
   And perilles appere to abundauntely
                                     For to love her.
