For to love her for her looks lovely
   My heart was set in thought right firmly,
   Trusting by truth to have had redress :
   But she hath made another promise,
   And hath given me leave full honestly.
  
   Yet do I not rejoice it greatly :
   For on my faith I loved too surely :
   But reason will that I do cease
                                     For to love her.
  
Since that in love the pain's been deadly,
   Me think it best that readily
   I do return to my first address ;
   For at this time too great is the press
   And perils appea
